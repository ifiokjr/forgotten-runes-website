(Lafayette CA, Los Angeles, CA, Austin, TX) – 12/15/21 — Bisonic Inc, a company backed by industry veterans from Maximum Games has entered into an agreement with Austin and Los Angeles-based Magic Machine to expand its digital content and NFT brand Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult. The two companies will establish a true web3 interactive fantasy MMO with sandbox elements that will become a hub for a variety of games and experiences.

Players will own land, socialize, collect resources, craft items, create lore, battle legendary beasts, and embark on epic quests. The game will be supported by key on-chain elements empowering players to create and mint their own custom nfts. These nfts will be used and sold in-game as well as on third-party marketplaces like OpenSea and the upcoming Coinbase NFT platform. The metaverse will expand the lore-based “Runiverse” into the interactive realm, growing the reach and awareness of the already flourishing Wizard Cult. There is a planned private and public land sale coming soon enabling anyone to own a corner of this soon to be realized world.

The Bisonic team has decades of collective experience producing, publishing and developing games such as Elder Scrolls Online, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Far Cry 3, Rainbow 6 Siege, Batman Arkham Origins, Killer Instinct, Street Fighter and more. The expertise of both companies will allow the Forgotten Runes community to play solo or as a group, creating a nearly limitless experience where anyone can create their own fantasy life through “create to earn” mechanics.

Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult launched in July of 2021 with 10,000 NFT’s and sold out in less than 30 minutes. The community, composed of passionate wizardry, occult, and fantasy fans are part of a collective who, through art, lore, and social interaction are building one of the most engaged NFT communities in the space.

“We entered into this alliance with Magic Machine as we firmly believe that the world they have created with Forgotten Runes and their community of holders has great opportunity to expand via gaming. They have unique thoughts on how to engage fantasy/wizardry fans in a way we have never seen and look forward to growing the story lines and community through many forms and functions gaming provides to new and existing fans of the property,” stated Jeldor, co-founder of Bisonic Inc.

“Bisonic understood our project immediately. Their game design expertise paired with our knowledge of the crypto/nft space makes for a potent partnership. We believe the value of NFTs goes far beyond the use cases we saw in 2021. In the new year, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult will break boundaries with this game as well as our upcoming animated content, comic book, 3D projects, DAO, and many other surprises.” stated Dotta and Elf Trul, founders of Magic Machine and creators of Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.

Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult is a collaborative legendarium rooted in blockchain technology. Wizard holders own their characters and bring fantasy role playing to a whole new level of authenticity. Through a unique model of decentralized IP development, the project is being expressed in a vast array of media. Highlights over the past few months include a TV development deal with Titmouse animation (BIG MOUTH), the community owned “Book of Lore” (on-chain lore scribing), production of a 10 comic mini-series, an art DAO, and a team-up with Coinbase NFT for exclusive drops.

Magic Machine’s model is disrupting legacy media’s IP structures by granting commercial rights to its NFT holders. In the short time since its inception, the Forgotten Runes community has become one of the most committed and creative in the space with art, poems, and animation being created daily. Where other brands allow consumers to be fans of their characters, the Forgotten Runes Wizard holders ARE their characters, personally and financially.

Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult games will roll out to consumers in 2022 with games, interactive creative tools, and an in-game NFT marketplace unique to the game and property. The first public land sale will take place at [insert game landing page URL] in Q1 of 2022, with more details coming soon.
