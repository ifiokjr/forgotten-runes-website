**June 30th, Launch!**
At roughly 8:30 am on [Ethereum block 12736300](https://etherscan.io/block/12736300), the Secret Tower came alive. The NFT community did not “mint” Wizards, they “summoned” them! All 10k Wizards were [summoned](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/summoning) in under 30 minutes, and the experience was hailed as one of the most exhilarating project launches in the NFT community at large. Project creators [@ElfJTrul](https://twitter.com/ElfJTrul) and [@dotta](https://twitter.com/dotta) rejoiced and immediately began the arduous task of completing all Roadmap items. The Cult begins.

**August 26, Murals!**
Days after launch, Elf and Dotta begin planning ways to spread the word of the Cult. A full-scale [mural campaign](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/murals) was launched and by August the first Wizard, Hedge Wizard Lenora of the Realm, [appeared on the wall of an arcade in Austin, Texas](https://twitter.com/forgottenrunes/status/1430545511027597313). Many other murals appeared soon after in Miami and Los Angeles.

**September 22, The Book of Lore!**
The Forgotten Runes [Book of Lore](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/writing-in-the-book-of-lore) is a core feature of the project. This digital tome allows Cult members to create on-chain lore about their Wizards. The Book of Lore is ever growing, ever changing, as hundreds of lore entries have been entered. This Book is a fundamental tool of the project which reinforces the core thesis: As an NFT holder, you are in control of the token's life, status, and growth. With creativity and engagement, you can level-up your Wizard to a status higher than when you received it. Creating Lore is a vital part of that leveling-up. All legends throughout history have a rich story behind them, and our Cult members are empowered to do the same for their Wizards. [“Lore not Floor”](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/lore-creation) is a mantra originating from the Cult.

**November 17th, Walk Cycles!**
Cult members were given yet another airdrop, this time [full walk cycles of their Wizards!](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/walkcycles) No longer were these NFTs just simple static images, now the Wizards were alive and able to fully walk around in all directions. These walks were first deployed into the super popular [Worldwide Webb 3](https://twitter.com/Worldwide_WEB3), meaning if you own a Wizard, you can fully walk around as your Wizard. Other open metas follow soon after including [Tollan Worlds](https://twitter.com/tollan_worlds), [hyaliko](https://twitter.com/hyaliko), and the upcoming [Atlantis World](https://twitter.com/atlantis0x). The founders believe that metaverse utility for NFTs is the strongest path forward.
