_Delete below sample to write your own_

This where you can write your lore.... we use markdown to store it on chain.... You can see how it will appear/render in the preview panel.

Here is some **bold** text

## Example of a medium heading
### Example of a smaller heading

# Images
You can add images via links, OR, upload from your computer using the toolbar.

### Image uploads

Use the toolbar image icon to upload an image to IPFS. Once uploaded (to IPFS) they also appear as a link, like so:

![wizards-2140-2-back.png](ipfs://QmNSLAeDX346AjSCVUrbD1YCBYRJz4hH3RLUVbAmx67VNz)

### External Image Links

To add image (or anything else) as a link, you can do it via the toolbar link icon, or just write the syntax below like so:

![An image](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/static/img/forgotten-runes-logo.png)

### Embedded videos

Oh yeah, if you just put in a YouTube link (no special syntax) on its own then it shows it embedded, see below:

# Getting new lines right

New lines can be a bit funny.... there are two options:

**First**

Press enter twice. I am typing here, and now pressing enter twice after three dotrs...

and now I am here (but you did get double spacing)

**Second**

Type two spaces *before* pressing enter. Here come two spaces after the three dots followed by enter...   
and now I am here

# Tagging other characters

You can tag other wizards, souls etc in any normal text (so not a heading or a link). Here are some examples:

Best wizard of all is @wizard2140. His dreams of befriending @pony0 one day. Watch out for @soul1732!
